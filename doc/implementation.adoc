an 'extend' expression specifies a model - a mapping from signature to
structure.  specifically it extends the signature of a type to include
some new operations, and maps the new ops to structure ops
(i.e. implementations).

parameterized models - all calls to these ops will be parameterized by
a type datum.  e.g. instead of (add a b), (add t a b).  the only
purpose of the type parameter is to determine dispatch-by-type - its
value is not used.
