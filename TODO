* "inheritance" - each algebra extends the previous one; a group is a
  monoid with commutativity.  reuse the code.  so for group sig, just
  declare commutativity law, and reuse the monoid protocol?  we cannot
  extend a protocol, but we can, in the model, extend a type to
  multiple protocols.  so we will have to put the laws in the protocol
  instead of just the namespace.  and we will have to figure out how
  to make the protocol operators from monoid available from the group
  namespace.

* coalgebra examples - e.g. a `stats` protocol for computing mean, mode etc. of collections
