signature files use defprotocol to declare sig for algebra; they also define axioms as functions

structure files define implementations for the operators declared in the sig protocol; they can have different names

model files use `extend` to map signature ops to structure fns

    installed-structs:  map from keywords to structure types

    a.  registers (install!) structures by storing an object to be used for dispatch
    	note: this applies the standard `structure` op to the sobj; the rule
	is that every structure must define the `structure` op to return a type keyword
	that will be used for dispatch; e.g. (structure structure.n0) => :n0

    b.  activates (activate!) a model by alter-var-root *active-model* to set a fn
    	the current design requires a custom activate! for each sig, in order
	to set the const syms

	for this to work the default structure (java.lang.Object) must
	check *active-model* in order to decide whether or not to
	forward the call.  in other words this forces us to include
	dispatch logic in the implementations

	core.matrix does this a little differently - it doesn't use a
	default impl, instead it has a dispatch layer for the sig,
	which, for each op, fetches the *active-model* and uses it as
	first arg in re-dispatch.

so a call to an op in a sig is always first dispatched to the default
model (since java.lang.Object matches everything), which then uses
*active-model* to re-dispatch.  this allows us to handle the default
case without a re-dispatch.

in core.matrix, calls are always re-dispatched.


Protocol dispatch is general.  The dispatch object can be of any type,
including an ad-hoc types defined using deftype.  This means that we
can "reify" protocols.  In a sense this compensates for the weakness
of having an OO implementation language.  We don't need to dispatch on
"real" data, we just need a type.

Also allows us to use Protocols as multimethods.  First dispatch goes
to a default implementation, which examines the args and then
re-dispatches on a selected dispatch object.  So we can view Protocols
as a mechanism for grouping multimethods.  Similar to the type classes of e.g. Haskell.
