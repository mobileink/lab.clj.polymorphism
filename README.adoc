== Group algebras

1. Fork/clone
2. `lein repl`, then do `refresh-all` (see dev/user.clj for config stuff)

Then explore.  Three Groups are provided; using them as a pattern it
should be easy to implement your own.

* N0:  (N, 0, +), underlying set is Natural numbers with zero, identity element is 0, operation is addition
* N1:  (N, 1, \*), underlying set is positive Natural numbers, identity element is 1, operation is multiplication
* Q3+:  quotient group mod 3 over integers, identity is 0, op is addition

== other stuff

The code in the `foo` subdir is a more basic example of protocols v. multimethods.
